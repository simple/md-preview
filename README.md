# MDPreview

md-preview is just a good enough solution to previewing markdown documents
as github styled HTML.

## Install

	$ pip install git+https://github.com/simple/md-preview.git


## Usage

	$ md-preview filename [ filename ... ]


## Caveats

By dropping the [GitHub Markdown Rendering API](http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/), it does not support GFM anymore(so I have changed the project name).

## Thanks

HTML template is borrowed from [ghmarkdownrender](https://github.com/magnetikonline/ghmarkdownrender).
